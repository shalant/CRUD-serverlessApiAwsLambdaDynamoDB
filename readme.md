# Built a Serverless CRUD API with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB, from Felix Yu on Youtube

## Why did I build this? Having received the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certifate a week ago, I decided to build some actual projects. Since I have a background in MERN, my first thought was to make CRUD applications and investigate Lambda functions. This youtube tutorial was a bitesize introduction.

## A great next step would be to add a front end that has buttons to perform all the CRUD actions. This tutorial used Postman.
